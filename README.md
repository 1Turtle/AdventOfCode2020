Advent of Code 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; Written in C++ &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; By Sammy.K aka. 1Turtle

these are my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) ðŸŽ„. the days are divided into single ``.cpp`` files _(including part 2)_ and can be easily compiled with the ``make`` command.
the code is **originally intended for linux** - but should work on other platforms, too!
